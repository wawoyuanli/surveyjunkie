                        <p>Founded in 2010, Lucid revolutionized the sampling industry with our creation of the first
                            global, programmatic marketplace. Through Lucid’s technology and innovation, the Marketplace
                            now connects buyers and sellers of survey sample across the world. Since inception,
                            thousands of sample buyers have managed over 5 million projects, for over 250 million
                            completes, in 112 countries, among 350 sample suppliers. </p>
                        <p>
                            The strengths of Lucid lie within the dynamics of a true marketplace – our demand and
                            supply-sides benefit from the transparent and open nature of the model. Lucid’s automated
                            platform creates ongoing opportunities for buyers and sellers to connect with unprecedented
                            reach – via multi-sourcing. It instantly connects buyers to hundreds of panels, identifies
                            the exact respondents needed, and matches them to surveys immediately. Our Marketplace also
                            reduces sampling bias because buyers know that their sample is coming from the widest pool
                            of respondents.

                            The Lucid Marketplace allows users to set up detailed project specifications and launch
                            within minutes. Many of the Marketplace’s unique functionalities are enabled by automation:
                            its multi-panel feasibility; deduplication technology; blending capabilities; push-button
                            fielding; and real-time analytics that enable informed decision making.

                            panels. The remaining 15% were sourced for supplying to panel builds and community recruits
                            from publishing networks, social media and non-incentivized sample sources that are uniquely
                            suited.

                            For Managed Services projects, Marketplace customers work with the project success team,
                            which handles the fielding strategy, inputting quotas, managing CPI, and monitoring the
                            study as it fields.

                            In our ProServe model, customers outsource the project in full to Lucid. The project success
                            team works from the customer’s account, handling the fielding strategy, inputting quotas,
                            managing CPI, and monitoring the study as it fields. In this scenario, survey-completes
                            count against the customer contract.

                            Self-serve (software) accounts are handled by the customer success team, which helps to
                            support Marketplace users as they manage and field their own studies.

                            Marketplace APIs enable users to access the Marketplace from their own platform. An API
                            integration is implemented by the customer’s or Lucid’s development resources in
                            coordination with Lucid’s Marketplace integrations team. These integrations can also be
                            customized.

                            The supplier blend can be determined on a survey-by-survey basis or at the account level.
                            Sample blends are easily duplicated over time with blend templates that can be applied at
                            both the survey level and account level – providing the same suppliers an identical or
                            similar allocation of completes each time. Lucid Supplier Quality Scores can help ensure

                            Reach, Lucid’s feasibility and price estimation tool enables every Lucid Marketplace user to
                            understand the future success of their study. To receive a feasibility estimation, users
                            must provide:

                            The Lucid Marketplace employs API-integrated sampling to allocate surveys to respondents
                            rather than rely on a survey router. Since 2016, Lucid provides an out-of-the-box
                            integration that allows suppliers to leverage API technology without undergoing an involved
                            development process.
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Lucid’s API-integrated sampling enables precision targeting of respondents with
                            opportunities for which they qualify — simultaneously eliminating inefficiencies while
                            enhancing the respondent experience. Additionally, Lucid Marketplace suppliers can customize
                            their integrations with the Lucid Marketplace API to enable advanced targeting.

                            One of the foundational beliefs of Lucid is end-to-end transparency. Marketplace clients
                            have complete, 24/7 access to all survey-or system-related data in real-time during the
                            project process directly through our web-based client reporting tools.

                            We deduplicate within a survey, survey group, or category by IP, participant ID, or cookies.
                            These settings are easily accessed and adjusted through the Marketplace user interface.

                            One of Lucid’s core differentiators is our depth of profiling. Over the past eight years,
                            more than 450 million respondents have been profiled across 28 billion data points.
                        </p>
                        <p>Using their API integrations, suppliers can continuously update respondent profiles according
                            to responses in the Lucid Marketplace. Additionally, to maximize the efficiency of our APIs,
                            we receive real-time profile data from our supplier sources via the URL string and
                            respondent validation data with our in-house Survey Protection features. </p>

                            that are used to screen respondents. Profiling info is refreshed every 30 days.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, the Marketplace tracks individual-level data such as recent participation
                            history, date of entry, and supplier source information. Lucid can access this information

                            supplier quality across the Marketplace, measures composition as one of its core metrics.
                            Respondents’ behavioral attributes are used in a time-series comparison that measures a
                            supplier’s source consistency. Additionally, the program measures platform-wide customer
                            satisfaction with each supplier based on reconciliation rates.

                        <p>These measures are indexed for each Marketplace supplier so buyers can make procurement and
