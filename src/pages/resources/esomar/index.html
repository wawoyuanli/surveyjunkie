                        <p>Founded in 2010, OnlineMoneyWorld revolutionized the sampling industry with our creation of the first
                            global, programmatic marketplace. Through OnlineMoneyWorld’s technology and innovation, the Marketplace
                            now connects buyers and sellers of survey sample across the world. Since inception,
                            thousands of sample buyers have managed over 5 million projects, for over 250 million
                            completes, in 112 countries, among 350 sample suppliers. </p>
                        <p>
                            The strengths of OnlineMoneyWorld lie within the dynamics of a true marketplace – our demand and
                            supply-sides benefit from the transparent and open nature of the model. OnlineMoneyWorld’s automated
                            platform creates ongoing opportunities for buyers and sellers to connect with unprecedented
                            reach – via multi-sourcing. It instantly connects buyers to hundreds of panels, identifies
                            the exact respondents needed, and matches them to surveys immediately. Our Marketplace also
                            reduces sampling bias because buyers know that their sample is coming from the widest pool
                            of respondents.

                            fielding; and real-time analytics that enable informed decision making.

                            suited.

                            For Managed Services projects, Marketplace customers work with the project success team,
                            which handles the fielding strategy, inputting quotas, managing CPI, and monitoring the
                            study as it fields.

                            In our ProServe model, customers outsource the project in full to OnlineMoneyWorld. The project success
                            team works from the customer’s account, handling the fielding strategy, inputting quotas,
                            managing CPI, and monitoring the study as it fields. In this scenario, survey-completes
                            count against the customer contract.

                            Self-serve (software) accounts are handled by the customer success team, which helps to
                            support Marketplace users as they manage and field their own studies.

                            Marketplace APIs enable users to access the Marketplace from their own platform. An API
                            integration is implemented by the customer’s or OnlineMoneyWorld’s development resources in
                            coordination with OnlineMoneyWorld’s Marketplace integrations team. These integrations can also be
                            customized.

                            The supplier blend can be determined on a survey-by-survey basis or at the account level.
                            Sample blends are easily duplicated over time with blend templates that can be applied at
                            both the survey level and account level – providing the same suppliers an identical or
                            similar allocation of completes each time. OnlineMoneyWorld Supplier Quality Scores can help ensure
                            consistent and replicable sampling.

                            Our Marketplace users fully control which suppliers are allowed to access the project via
                            the Marketplace software as well as passthrough supplier identifiers so that the sample mix
                            can be tracked within the survey platform. While in-field, suppliers can be added or removed
                            according to project requirements with complete transparency.

                            The OnlineMoneyWorld Marketplace employs API-integrated sampling to allocate surveys to respondents
                            rather than rely on a survey router. Since 2016, OnlineMoneyWorld provides an out-of-the-box
                            integration that allows suppliers to leverage API technology without undergoing an involved
                            development process.

                        <p>

                            OnlineMoneyWorld’s API-integrated sampling enables precision targeting of respondents with
                            opportunities for which they qualify — simultaneously eliminating inefficiencies while
                            enhancing the respondent experience. Additionally, OnlineMoneyWorld Marketplace suppliers can customize
                            their integrations with the OnlineMoneyWorld Marketplace API to enable advanced targeting.

                            project process directly through our web-based client reporting tools.

                            we receive real-time profile data from our supplier sources via the URL string and
                            respondent validation data with our in-house Survey Protection features. </p>

                        <p>Additionally, the Marketplace tracks individual-level data such as recent participation

                            supplier quality across the Marketplace, measures composition as one of its core metrics.
                            Respondents’ behavioral attributes are used in a time-series comparison that measures a
                            supplier’s source consistency. Additionally, the program measures platform-wide customer
                            satisfaction with each supplier based on reconciliation rates.

                        <p>These measures are indexed for each Marketplace supplier so buyers can make procurement and
