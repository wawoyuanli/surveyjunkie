        THE BEST FREELANCE WEBSITES FOR BEGINNERS: GET HIRED AS A FREELANCER
      </p>
      <p class="text-center">
        ----------------October 28, 2021----------------
      </p>
      <p>
        In this era of a growing global economy, job vacancies in one country
        can now be filled by candidates working remotely from another country.
        Various freelance sites have launched job boards where companies post
        their openings for those seeking employment opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of the type of employment, small businesses and big
        corporations leverage freelance marketplaces to find the best candidates
        for the job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beginner freelancers with a distinct skillset can offer their services
        to marketplaces providing a wide range of opportunities. They can
        showcase their skills and connect with reliable employers through
        user-friendly processes offered by a variety of freelance platforms. For
        those with highly technical skills, specialized platforms can yield
        better matches in less time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When taking a crack at the gig economy, newbie freelancers can choose
        from a broad array of options that include the following platforms.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Toptal</p>
      <p class="h5 text-danger">toptal - best freelance websites</p>
      <p>
        Toptal is a great freelance site for experts and professionals with
        extensive skills and experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the name indicates, only top applicants, around 3% of freelance
        talent worldwide, are accepted. A resource to top companies across the
        globe, Toptal is not exactly a beginner-friendly option but offers
        high-quality opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The industries covered include health and life sciences, consumer
        products and services, and financial services. Brands such as Airbnb and
        Shopify are paying clients. High-paying opportunities with no fees await
        interested freelancers.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Freelancer</p>
      <p class="h5 text-danger">freelancer - the best freelance websites</p>
      <p>
        Freelancer.com has the largest pool of freelancers and employers.
        Professionals from more than 247 countries vie for projects posted on
        this freelance platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professional areas include design, data entry, invoicing, sales and
        marketing, engineering and science, copywriting, translation and
        language, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        A unique feature is their contest format, where only winning freelancers
        who submit their piece will be paid by the business that posted the
        work.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Upwork</p>
      <p class="h5 text-danger">upwork - the best freelance websites</p>
      <p>
        A platform with plentiful opportunities is Upwork, one of the best
        freelancing websites. Formerly named Elance-ODesk, the company
        relaunched as Upwork in 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
        With postings of over 3 million jobs annually, Upwork freelancers can
        find various types of work, from short- to long-term contracts paid with
        fixed price or hourly rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        New users are given 80 free Connects, which freelancers can use to
        submit proposals to potential employers. Outside of that, Connects cost
        $0.15 each.
      </p>
      <p>
        One downside, however, is the 20% payout fee for profits of $500 or
        less. Although it takes time to become reputable on this platform,
        Upwork’s protection of their freelancers’ work and payment make it
        worthwhile.
