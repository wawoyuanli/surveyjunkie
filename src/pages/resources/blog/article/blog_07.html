      <p class="text-center">NEED MONEY NOW? 12 FAST WAYS TO EARN</p>
      <p class="text-center pt-5 pb-5">
        ________________________________________February 17,
        2021________________________________________
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re in a position where you need money quickly, you’re not alone.
        When unexpected life events arise — like home repairs, medical bills, or
        the coronavirus pandemic — you may find yourself in a situation where
        you’re searching for extra cash. Don’t fret if you don’t have an
        emergency fund — there are lots of ways to get money fast in the ways
        that work for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this article, we’re outlining simple ways to earn and borrow money,
        so you can tackle whatever you need, no matter how urgent. Let’s get
        started.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">I need cash. How can I earn money now?</p>
      <p>
        Emergency expenses come up all the time. If you want to earn your own
        money, without the help of a lender, try out the options we’ve listed
        below. Naturally, these solutions will require some time commitment, but
        they’re easy ways to make quick cash and don’t require repayment.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Take Surveys</p>
      <p>
        Taking surveys is a great way to earn easy money in your free time.
        Whether you have a break in between your day, are on your commute, or
        lounging at home, you can make money anywhere at any time on any device
        with Survey Junkie.
      </p>
      <p>
        How does Survey Junkie work? Sign up for an account and complete your
        general profile to start getting matched with surveys that fit your
        interests and experiences. You’ll get points for each survey you
        successfully complete and can cash out via PayPal, bank transfer, or
        e-gift cards. Plus, Survey Junkie has one of the lowest payout
        thresholds, which means you can cash out after earning just $5! The more
        surveys you complete, the more money you can generate.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Sell Things You Don’t Need</p>
      <p>
        It doesn’t need to be spring for you to do some spring cleaning. Look
        through your closets, cabinets, and garage for extra items you don’t
        need. Sell them on sites like Craigslist or eBay to turn up some fast
        cash. Another option is to hold a small garage sale to get rid of
        multiple items at once.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Deliver Food or Groceries</p>
      <p>
        If you have a car and a valid driver’s license, you can earn money
        delivering food or groceries in your local neighborhood. Sign up with
        Doordash or Postmates where you can choose the hours you want to work
        and the gigs you want to take on. Another option is signing up with
        Amazon Fresh — where you can deliver pre-packaged groceries — or
        Instacart — where you can do the shopping and delivery yourself.
