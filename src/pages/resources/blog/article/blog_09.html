        Amazon has dominated the online marketplace, offering access to hundreds
        of thousands of items all across the globe. Notoriously known for their
        quick turnarounds and delivery through Amazon Prime, the ecommerce giant
        has penetrated almost every industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re shopping for groceries, purchasing a t-shirt, or
        streaming movies, you can do it all through Amazon. While most of your
        time on their site might be allocated towards spending, there’s also
        lots of ways to make money directly on Amazon. In this article, we’re
        explaining different ways you can make money online and offline through
        Amazon, helping you earn passive income with no full-time job required.
        As an added bonus, you can also read some of our favorite tips to

      <p class="h4">Make Money Online Sell Products with Amazon FBA</p>
      <p>
        What is Amazon FBA? FBA is just a fancy term for “fulfillment by
        Amazon”. Essentially, this allows you to:
      </p>
      <p>1.Become an Amazon seller</p>
      <p>2.Create or purchase wholesale products</p>
      <p>3.Ship your inventory to Amazon fulfillment centers</p>

      <p>
        What makes FBA so convenient is that as a seller, all you need to do is
        ship your inventory to Amazon’s warehouse. They take care of shipping
        your products for you, so you don’t need to worry about the hassle. You
        may choose to ship the products yourself, to avoid extra fees from
        Amazon, but FBA makes it easy for you to sell without having to deal
        with all the logistics.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can get involved in a few different ways. The first is online
        arbitrage, which is reselling items at a higher price after buying them
        from online stores like Ebay or Alibaba. The second is retail arbitrage,
        or reselling after buying from a local retail store like Walmart. The
        third option is private labeling, where you buy a finished product and
        brand it under your own name.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Here are our tips to get started with Amazon FBA:</p>
      <p>
        1.Choose your plan. — Individual plans will cost you $0.99 with every
        item sold but Professional plans will cost $39.99 every month, no matter
        how much you sell. On top of these fees, Amazon will charge you a
        referral fee on each sale, which varies depending on the category and
        amount you’re selling.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Do Affiliate Marketing (Amazon Associates)</p>

      <p>
        The Amazon Associates program is an affiliate program that rewards you
        through commissions without making you invest any money. Here’s how it
        works. You promote an Amazon product to your friends, family, or social
        media following. Every time that product is purchased through your
        affiliate link, you get paid a commission.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a great option for bloggers and influencers interested in
        sharing products with their fan base. Even if you don’t have a blog, you
        can still join using your Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, or YouTube
        channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll probably have the most success as an Amazon affiliate promoting
        products that are relevant to you. For example, if your blog is about
        fitness and lifestyle tips, you can promote workout gear or healthy
        snacks. And the best part? This is a completely doable work from home
        option.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Publish a Book</p>
      <p>
        If you love writing, then consider publishing a book on Amazon. Home to
        one of the largest online bookstores, Amazon is a great place to get
        your name in front of millions of people worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can publish ebooks directly through Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing
        or KDP. It’ll take only a few minutes to publish, but then your book
        will be available all across Kindle stores within 24 to 48 hours!
        Additionally, you may choose to create printed versions of your book if
        anyone is interested in purchasing a physical copy.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Create Custom Merch</p>
      <p>
        Ever wanted to sell your designs but didn’t know where to start? Now,
        you can start a side hustle selling your designs on all kinds of
        products with Merch by Amazon. From t-shirts and hats to mugs and bags,
        Merch will print your designs on almost anything! All you have to do is
        upload your designs into the Amazon database, select your colors, and
        choose a price.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amazon will take over the process from there. Each time a sale is made,
        Amazon will print the product, pack it, and ship it for you. Plus,
        they’ll handle customer service requests and any issues that may come
        up. What’s the catch? Amazon will charge you a royalty fee with each
        purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started, you have to apply to join Merch by Amazon. The process
        to get approved can take up to three months, so it’s better to apply
        early if you have a specific timeline in mind. Joining the program comes
        at no cost, but you will need to fill out an application.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t need to be a professional designer to sell your designs. In
        fact, you can use free platforms like Canva, where you can easily drag
        and drop elements together to create a design of your own. It’s a lot
        easier than you may think!
