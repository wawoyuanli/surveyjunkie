        <p>
            The answer depends. If you’re looking to make a couple hundred dollars, that’s easy! If you’re looking to

        <p class="h4">Ways to Make Money Online</p>
        <p class="h5">1.Online Course</p>
        <p>
            Online education isn’t new, but it’s grown exponentially due to the pandemic. Students and professionals all
            across the world have turned to online learning because it’s convenient, accessible, and and time-saving.
            Workers with full-time jobs choose online education because it easily fits in their schedule and allows them
            to differentiate themselves with unique skills and knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re a subject matter expert or you’re passionate about teaching others, then you can make money online
            through an online course. Students flock to sites like Udemy to learn everything from web development and
            entrepreneurship, to graphic design and art.
        </p>
        <p class="h5">2.Consulting</p>
        <p>
            Do you enjoy working with others? Do people tell you that you give good advice? If you answered yes, then
            consulting may be for you. All types of companies, especially small businesses, hire consultants to help
            them strategize for their business. Of course, you will have to have knowledge of the industry or practice,
            but you won’t need to know everything about business to succeed.
        </p>
        <p>As a consultant, you can make a lot of money offering expertise into a specific subject area. For example,
            you can be a consultant for the financial team, strategy and operations team, or marketing team. Your job is
            to help problem-solve, strategize, offer recommendations, or streamline processes. The best part is, you
            choose what you offer to each client.</p>
        <p class="h5">3.Online Surveys</p>
        <p>
            Rather than scrolling through social media when you’re bored, take some online surveys and earn money doing
            it. Survey Junkie makes it easy to earn extra money for your opinion. Your voice and time are invaluable to
            brands who want to improve their products and services. Survey Junkie has a direct relationship with those

            PayPal, bank transfer or gift cards to retailers like Walmart, Target, Starbucks and more! Plus, survey
            taking is a really fun and productive way to spend your spare time. Learn more and sign up today!
        </p>
        <p class="h5">4.Amazon Reseller</p>
        <p>Amazon is a great way to put extra money in your wallet. In fact, you can make a decent profit reselling
            items on Amazon. While you will need to invest money and time for research upfront, it can pay off in the
            end.</p>
        <p>There are thousands of retailers on Amazon, which may make it difficult for you to grab a sale compared to
            someone else. To make yourself stand out from the crowd, consider a branding and pricing strategy that
            aligns with your target audience. The more you sell and the more 5-star reviews you attain, the higher your
            store will rank in Amazon searches.</p>
        <p class="h5">5.Google AdSense</p>
        <p>If you’re looking for passive income, Google AdSense is an easy way to go. If you have a website or blog, you
            can make money by placing ads on it. Google AdSense will match ads to your website based on the content
            you’re posting and the audience you’re writing to. </p>
        <p>Ads are created and paid for by advertisers who want to promote their products to your audience. The prices
            they pay will vary depending on the type and placement of the ad. Plus, you’ll have the option to customize
            the ads that appear on your website. Try out the Google AdSense calculator to get an estimate on how much
            money you can earn.</p>
        <p class="h5">6.Freelancing</p>
        <p>Freelancing is the perfect option for anyone who wants to start their own side gig that can turn quickly into
            a full-time career. You can do just about anything as a freelancer: writing, editing, graphic design, and
            more!</p>
        <p>What’s great about freelancing is that you set your own schedule and take on the projects of your choice.
            Plus, you set your own pricing for your services. The more projects or clients you take on, the more money
            you can make — but it’s all up to your availability and liking. Companies will post jobs on sites like
            Fiverr and Indeed. Check them out to get started!</p>
