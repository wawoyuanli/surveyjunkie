        Are you aware that TikTok has over 2 billion downloads globally on
        Google Play and App Store? Anyone who has been on the internet over the
        past few years has most likely heard of this social video app whose
        popularity has been soaring. In fact, you may have already interacted
        with TikTok videos on other popular social media platforms, like
        Facebook and Instagram, if you aren’t already on TikTok.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every day, the average TikTok user spends roughly 52 minutes on the app,
        opening it around eight times per day. This is one of the reasons why
        more companies are becoming interested in the platform and even
        encouraging their staff to post videos while at work.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the exponential growth of this social video-sharing app, brands and
        marketers worldwide are now opening channels to engage with TikTok users
        and gain more customers. Creating an effective TikTok marketing strategy
        requires you to identify your target audience and create intriguing
        content to develop brand awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        TikTok is a social media app that allows users to create and share video
        content — both amateur and professional videos. This popular
        video-sharing app, owned by a tech company based in Beijing — ByteDance
        — lets users produce short-form videos, mostly around 15 seconds. TikTok
        basically relies on user-generated content to drive traffic, mostly Gen
        Z, to its platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        TikTok users have to scroll through the app’s feed to watch and interact
        with other users on the platform. They can find TikTok videos from any
        niche on the platform, including DIY videos, pet videos, auto videos,
        and food videos. The app’s popularity rocketed mainly due to dance
        videos, where people basically recorded themselves dancing to hit songs
        on the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        TikTok offers various editing effects to spice up videos. It also comes
        with “like,” “comment,” and “share” buttons. The share button lets users
        send TikTok videos to other TikTok users or to users of other social
        media apps, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a TikTok account, users on the platform can like your videos
        and follow you to view the content you upload. Additionally, they can
        also set up alerts so that they receive notifications when you go live
        or post videos.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">What is the Target Audience for TikTok?</p>
      <p>
        Like any other social media platform, you should always create and post
        content that resonates with your target audience. In the U.S., TikTok
        has approximately 100 million monthly active users and about 50 million
        active users daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary target audience for TikTok is the young population.
        Remember, this social network was originally created for short-form
        dance videos targeted at teenagers. The main user demographic of this
        social media app is the Gen Z population. This generation includes all
        people born between 1997 and 2012. Most users of TikTok are under 30
        years old, with the majority being between 16 and 24 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
        When thinking about TikTok marketing, make sure your strategies align
        with your target audience to get the most out of this popular platform.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Why Do You Need a TikTok Marketing Strategy?</p>
      <p>
        Today, many brands use social media to gain a competitive edge over
        their competitors. An effective TikTok marketing strategy can help you
        reach a larger audience since you can share video content with your
        next-door neighbor or a TikTok user at the other end of the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Digital marketing has now become easier given the platform’s
        ever-growing audience. A practical TikTok marketing strategy can help
        you to:
