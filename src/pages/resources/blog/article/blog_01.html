    <p class="text-center">HOW TO MAKE MONEY PODCASTING: 5 SIMPLE STRATEGIES</p>
    <p class="text-center">----------------October 28, 2021----------------</p>
    <p class="h5">how to make money podcasting</p>
    <p>How do podcasts make money? This is a valid question to ask yourself when you’ve been pouring time, effort, and
      resources into running a podcast. From business owners seeking to grow a client base to hobbyists looking to share
      interests, podcasts are a great way to supplement your income. Here is further insight into a few innovative
      podcast monetization strategies. </p>
    <p class="h4">1. Use Affiliate Marketing</p>
    <p class="h5">make money podcasting with affiliate marketing</p>
    <p>Affiliate marketing is an excellent first step towards earning you money from being a content creator. You can
      enroll in many affiliate programs for free and without having a large following to start. As a podcast host, you
      get tasked with recommending a service or a product to your audience.</p>
    <p>You will get a commission for every new lead or purchase made through your endorsement. Through affiliate
      marketing, you also get to share services and products you like effectively.</p>
    <p class="h4">How to Use Affiliate Marketing to Monetize a Podcast</p>
    <p>So how do you start? Pick a product you like and would enjoy recommending to your listeners. Also, since you
      understand your audience, you should choose a product that best appeals to them. This evaluation essentially helps
      you find a good match that balances your interests and that of your audience. You thus avoid losing your loyal
      following by endorsing products that align with the ideals and principles identifying your show.</p>
    <p class="h4">How to Find Affiliate Programs for Your Podcast</p>
    <p>You will find a diverse list of prospective affiliate programs in every possible niche and industry through a
      quick online search. You can decide to directly contact a company with an affiliate program or sign up for an
      affiliate network that connects you with several programs.</p>
    <p>Once you sign up for an affiliate program, you will obtain a unique referral link to share with your audience.
      You can add the affiliate link to your:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Podcast intro and outro</li>
      <li>Podcast episode descriptions and show notes</li>
      <li>Podcast social media account such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram</li>
      <li>Podcast Website</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After picking a product, you can develop different strategies for presenting it to your audience. Affiliate
      marketing on your podcast can be as easy as adding a simple shout-out during your show to promote the product. If
      the affiliate link is simple to spell out, you can provide several mentions during the show for your audience to
      type in and search.</p>
    <p>As a podcaster, your website can be an important tool if appropriately used for affiliate marketing. Apart from
      housing your bio and links to the latest episodes as well as podcast recordings, you can also include affiliate
      links on your website. By sharing the affiliate link here, your audience can easily access the recommended
      services or products at the click of a button.</p>
    <p>You can choose to develop a unique or catchy link and then add a hyperlink to the affiliate link.</p>
    <p class="h4"> 2.Do Sponsorships & Advertisements</p>
    <p class="h5">make money podcasting with sponsors and ads</p>
    <p>Sponsorships and advertising are likely the first strategies you consider when thinking of ways to make money
      podcasting. Podcast sponsorships and ads are deals you strike with a brand to help increase their brand awareness
      and sell their products. The amount of money you receive from sponsors and ads is determined using two metrics.
      These are namely:</p>
    <p class="h4">CPM (Cost Per Mile)</p>
    <p>The CPM model refers to how much your sponsors pay for every 1,000 downloads of your podcast, every 1,000
      impressions on your social media posts, or every 1,000 views on your podcast videos. Deals in CPM pricing sound
      something like, “I’ll pay you $30 for every 1,000 views on your podcast videos.” CPM is the ideal metric for
      podcast shows with a large following. </p>
    <p class="h4">CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)</p>
    <p>The CPA model measures the number of signups or sales the promoted business gets through podcast advertising. CPA
      is the right metric for podcast shows with a small following but a highly engaged audience.</p>
    <p>You can direct listeners to make purchases through a unique link on your blog or offer an exclusive discount
      coupon code. These sales conversion routes help track prospective and actual clients interested in the product
      from listening to your podcast.</p>
    <p>When it comes to pricing, there isn’t a standard set for podcasting rates. The pricing depends on your current
      podcast reach and the type of sponsor. Sponsors that use CPM spend an average of $15 to $25 for every 1,000
      downloads. Meanwhile, sponsors that use CPA typically spend $15 to $30 on each person that buys their product or
      signs up for their services. </p>
    <p>Podcast adverts also differ in charges depending on their ad spot placements in your podcast. The three main ad
      spots are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-roll, which is at the start of your podcast</li>
      <li>Mid-roll, which is at the middle of your podcast during a commercial break</li>
      <li>Post-roll at the end of your podcast</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pre-roll ads are usually the cheapest and priced at $18. Despite this being what your audience first hears, it
      is generally brief (lasting about 15 seconds) and is straightforward. Mid-rolls have slightly higher pricing
      since they are longer (lasting about 60 seconds). It allows you to provide more detail, like reading out the
      main talking points provided by your sponsor. You can also improvise to make the advert sound more authentic to
      your listeners.</p>
    <p class="h4">How to Get Potential Sponsors for Your Podcast</p>
    <p>Just like in affiliate marketing, you can find prospective sponsors by doing a Google search. Online searches
      can help you find companies seeking help in marketing products that match your listener’s interests. If you
      aren’t sure which company to partner with, feel free to consult your fellow podcasters, friends, and even your
      audience.</p>

    <p>Once you choose a potential sponsor, you can create a presentation and email a detailed pitch to them. The
      information contained may include details about your podcast, suggested pricing, and podcast team. You can also
      include your audience demographics like views, download statistics, tweets, and posts.</p>
    <p>Being thorough is an excellent way of ensuring a good first impression. Send your pitch to as many suitable
      prospects as you can find to improve your chances of getting a deal. You can send a follow-up email one week after
      the first email and end it with a gracious note.</p>
