      <p class="text-center">
        _______________________________________February 24,

      </p>
      <p>
        Believe it or not, you don’t have to work full-time in an office to make
        money. Traditionally, jobs may have revolved around being present in a
        physical office. Today, tons of companies have switched to remote jobs
        and are looking for employees to work full-time or part-time completely
        from home.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re wondering whether you can make money online from the comfort
        of your home, we’re here to tell you it’s possible! There’s lots of
        online jobs and work from home options you can take advantage of. In
        this article, we’re outlining the 20 best online jobs to make money from
        anywhere.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Medium Writer</p>
      <p>
        Medium is a platform where you can get paid to write stories and
        articles. The more views and interactions your stories get, the more
        money you can get paid. This is a great option for those who don’t want
        to start blogging on their own and prefer to use a platform that already
        exists. While the top earners on Medium make $10,000 a month, this isn’t
        a realistic earn amount. Most writers earn approximately $100 a month,
        but the more you write the more you earn. As your readership starts to
        grow, you can branch out onto your own personalized blog and start
        driving traffic there.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Paid Surveys</p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re a college student or working professional, paid surveys
        are the perfect option for anyone looking to make extra side money.
        Sure, you won’t be able to make a full-time living by taking surveys,
        but you can earn enough to cover your coffee or certain entertainment
        expenses. On Survey Junkie, you get paid to share your opinions with big
        brands. We created our platform because we believe in equal
        representation and fair compensation for your efforts. Sign up, complete
        your profile, take surveys, and get paid! Cash out via bank transfer,
        PayPal, or e-gift cards.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Transcriptionist</p>
      <p>
        Transcription is an easy home job that doesn’t take any special
        knowledge or previous experience to do. Companies often outsource
        transcription jobs since they can be time consuming and require a strict
        attention to detail. If you’re someone who’s detail oriented and don’t
        mind building up your clientele, being a transcriptionist might be the
        right fit for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        All it involves is listening to audio and video files and writing down
        what you hear. Some sites may test you on your typing skills and
        grammar, but if your English is good, it’s nothing to worry about!
        Certain sites may charge you different rates per minute of transcribing,
        so be sure to look into the payment details before starting. Check out
        Transcribe Me, Go Transcript, or Scribie to start earning!
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Virtual Assistant</p>
      <p>
        Being a virtual assistant is a lot easier than you might think.
        Companies and even busy professionals are often looking for assistants
        to help with easy tasks that they don’t have time for. Your
        responsibilities as a virtual assistant typically involve scheduling
        events or meetings, administrative functions, or customer support. Plus,
        you can earn between $19 to $25 an hour! Search for remote assistant
        jobs on sites like Indeed or FlexJobs.
      </p>
      <p class="h4">Customer Service Representative</p>
      <p>
        If you don’t mind interacting with customers and helping resolve their
        issues, then consider becoming a customer service representative. The
        good thing about being a customer service representative is that there
        are tons of job opportunities. Companies are always needing to hire reps
        and the work can be done completely online and from the comfort of your
        own home. The downside is that you won’t make a ton of money as a
        customer service representative and you’ll encounter angry clients. Most
        customer service jobs pay on average around $13 or $14.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to earn a little more, try searching for job titles like
        “Customer Experience Associate” or “Customer Engagement Associate”,
        since those tend to pay slightly higher hourly wages. These positions
        may demand a higher skill level and knowledge on customer retention,
        re-selling, or up-selling.
