            <p class="text-left mt-3">
            You agree that all of your transactions with the Site (and the Site's transactions with you) 
            will be conducted by email or similar electronic communications (this is imperative because the 
            economics of online panels simply do not permit communication by regular mail or telephone). 
            If you need to contact us by phone, or if we need to contact you, you agree that phone conversations 
            (if any) may be recorded. Regardless of method of transaction or contact, all of the terms of 
            this Agreement remain the same. If the law allows you to withdraw this consent or if we are ever 
            required to handle transactions or communications non-electronically (or if electronic communications 
            increase in cost or are taxed), we reserve the right to charge your Member Account to cover any such 
            incremental communication costs. You agree to update the information in your Member Account at least every 
            12 months (or more often if necessary) so that the information therein is current, accurate, and true. 
            You agree to maintain your correct and current email address in Member Account at all times, and understand 
            that failure to maintain a correct email address means your Member Account will become Non-Compliant and that 
            you will not earn the Points that may have accumulated in your Member Account, as explained in section 8.J. 
            You further understand and agree that your failure to respond to email or similar electronic communications 
            from the Site for a period of eighteen (18) consecutive months or thirty (30) consecutive occasions and failure 
            to respond to notice thereof for a period of 30 days is a breach of this Agreement and means that your Member 
            Account will become Non-Compliant and that you will not earn the Points that may have accumulated in your Member Account.

            when you update your registration information. It is your responsibility to keep your email address current and accurate 
            in your OnlineMoneyWorld Member Account. Failure to maintain an accurate email address in your Member Account violates the 
            terms and conditions of this Agreement and will mean that you do not earn the Points that may accumulate in your Member 
            Account, as explained in 8.J. You further agree that the Site may from time to time attach script to its emails to help

            H. Redeeming Incentives - You may redeem Points once you have accumulated at least 1,000 Points in your 
            Member Account and you choose how you want to redeem the Points, i.e., contribute to a charity, trade for 
            other rewards or incentives, participate in promotional offers, or redeem for cash (check or Paypal). 
            Until you reach the 1,000-Point minimum and until you choose what to do with the Points, the Points are 
            Unearned and have no cash or monetary value. The 1,000-Point minimum may be changed by OnlineMoneyWorld from 
            time to time, but not without posting notification on the Site. You may review your Member Account Points 
            at any time by going to onlinemoneyworld.com and clicking on "Login" and logging in with your email address and password. 
            If you choose to redeem Points for cash or money, you will have the choice of payment in U.S. Dollars (USD) or your 
            local currency (converted at the prevailing exchange rate on day of redemption).

            or other legal methods at the Site's discretion. To ensure the highest quality for our clientele, 
            OnlineMoneyWorld panel must validate all cash-out requests before processing incentives. To do this, 
            we verify name and mailing address, along with survey responses on paid surveys. We also verify 
            that each response is answered in a reasonable time period and that responses are not invalidated due 
            to "cheater traps" or other deceitful means, as this breaks our member agreement to ensure honest answers. 
            This process could take up to 30 days. Once validated, OnlineMoneyWorld will process your transaction within 6 to 8 weeks.

            years, the check will become null and void, and an equivalent number of Points will be credited to your Member Account. 
            Thereafter, you may redeem any Earned Points in your Member Account at any time. Similarly, if you choose to receive payment 
            by PayPal and the payment is returned to us as "unclaimed," "denied," or "returned," we will notify you by email and mail 
            a check to you.

            Please be aware that, in order to be effective, your notice of claim must comply with the detailed requirements

            <p class="text-left h4">20. Communications Decency Act</p>
            <p class="text-left mt-3">
            Please note that OnlineMoneyWorld is a provider of an interactive computer service under 
            the Communications Decency Act or "CDA" (see 47 U.S.C. § 230). Because this important law is not well known, 
            we want to take a moment to explain the law.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left mt-3">
            The CDA provides that when a user writes and posts material on a website such as the Site, 
            the website itself cannot, in most cases, be held legally responsible for the posted material. 
            Specifically, 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1) states, "No provider or user of an interactive computer service 
            shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.
            " Because the comments and opinions on the Site are authored by users of the Site, we cannot be legally regarded 
            as the "publisher or speaker" of the content contained here, and hence we are not liable for the content even 
            if it contains false or inaccurate information.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left h4">21. Dispute Resolution</p>
            <p class="text-left mt-3">
            Any dispute arising between you and OnlineMoneyWorld (whether grounded in contract, tort, statute, law or equity) 
            or relating in any way to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be finally determined by binding arbitration 
            administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules. 
            The arbitration shall be conducted in New York, before a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the applicable 
            rules of the AAA. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. 
            Discovery during the arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and shall be limited 
            to the exchange of relevant documents and depositions of the Parties. No Party is precluded from seeking and obtaining 
            injunctive or other emergency relief, and the election to do so by a Party shall not be construed as a waiver of arbitration.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left mt-3">
            Any dispute must be raised within one (1) year after the date the cause of action arose. 
            Failure to provide the written documentation within this timeframe will render all claims related to the dispute null and void.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left h4">22. Governing Law and Venue</p>
            <p class="text-left mt-3">
